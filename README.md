Hi, this is Gautham Bharati from IIT Jammu.
Here the files contain my solution and the dataset used to the problem statement of Zocket(company) hackathon "Ad Creative Recognition with Computer Vision".
This dataset was taken from the following link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/51/internet+advertisements. 
I found this dataset the most relevant to find an approach to solve this problem statement. 
The main objective or aim of this project was to categorize an image as either an "advertisement image" or "non-ad image" and finding which features potentially affect it the most.
